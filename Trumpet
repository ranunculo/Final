			<h3>History</h3>
				<p>The trumpet is the highest pitched brass instrument. Trumpets were not originally used for music, instead being used as signals for battle or hunting. They were first used around 1500 B.C.E., but only used in music in the 15th century and beyond. The earliest examples of trumpets are far off from what we normally think of as a trumpet. Many lacked valves, and although these were used in orchestras, they lacked a large range in notes.</p>

				<p>Trumpets can vary in size, shape, key, and pitch. The smallest trumpet, the piccolo trumpet is one octave higher than the standard Bb trumpet. There is also the pocket trumpet, which is in the key of Bb, and has the same range, but is more compact than a regular trumpet. </p> 
				<p>Trumpets can also be found in the lower range. The bass trumpet and contrabass trumpet can both play lower than the standard trumpet, but are often played by trombonists.</p>

				<h3>In Music</h3>
				<p>The trumpet is used in many genres of music. Jazz and classical are the most common, in which trumpet can play a large role in the music. In classical music, the trumpet is usually used to accent and support other instruments, whereas in jazz, the first trumpet will often lead the rest of the band. Trumpets are also often found in many other genres of music, in mariachi...</p>

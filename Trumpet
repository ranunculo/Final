			<h3>History</h3>
				<img id="summitvalve" src="http://whyharrelson.weebly.com/uploads/3/9/5/5/3955654/7755412_orig.jpg">
				<p>The trumpet is the highest pitched brass instrument. Trumpets were not originally used for music, instead being used as signals for battle or hunting. They were first used around 1500 B.C.E., but only used in music in the 15th century and beyond. The earliest examples of trumpets are far off from what we normally think of as a trumpet. Many lacked valves, and although these were used in orchestras, they lacked a large range in notes.</p>
				<p>When piston valves were finally implemented in the trumpet, its range increased dramatically. Although there are several different achievable notes in the open position, valves are used to push the air through more tubing, which in turn lowers the pitch. Rotary valves are also used, more commonly used in European Orchestras. Rotary valves use the same method of changing the notes, but are placed on the side of the trumpet.</p>
		
			<h3>Varieties and Construction</h3>
				<p>Trumpets can vary in size, shape, key, and pitch. The smallest trumpet, the piccolo trumpet is one octave higher than the standard Bb trumpet. There is also the pocket trumpet, which is in the key of Bb, and has the same range, but is more compact than a regular trumpet. </p> 
				<p>Trumpets can also be found in the lower range. The bass trumpet and contrabass trumpet can both play lower than the standard trumpet, but are more often played by trombonists.</p>

				<p>The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape. Players create sound by blowing air through closed lips, producing a "buzzing" sound into the mouthpiece, which causes vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. One can change the pitch by changing their embouchure.
				<h3>In Music</h3>
				<p>The trumpet often has a bright, brassy sound. Cornets can usually be considered a somewhat mellower instrument. Another relative of the trumpet is the flugelhorn. It reaches an even smoother sound than both the others. Chuck Mangione is a famous flugelhorn player, who plays jazz flugelhorn. One of his most popular songs is "Feels So Good".</p>
				<p>Trumpets are used in art music styles, in orchestras and in concert bands, as well as in popular music styles such as jazz. </p>
